# AI Detector: A service for detecing AI input

This service is intended to be used as an internal check for text that may have been generated by AI. With the provided text, this service will return a score that will indicate its likelyhood that the text is AI-generated.

The goal is NOT to make any value judgment on the result, but to give that information for the consumer to decide.
